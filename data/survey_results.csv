CPR ongoing by multiple responders you can hear in the background.","Question 18:     HR   RR   SpO2   BP   Temp     0   0   0   0   Not done     17 YO male was playing with his father's hunting rifle inside the house and shot himself through the chest and abdomen. His younger brother was in the room and saw the gun go off-it didn't hit anything else. He called his parents who called CHAP. When CHAP arrived, parents had already started CPR, blood everywhere and still bleeding, but CHAP can't find a pulse and is a lone responder.","Question 19:      HR   RR   SpO2   BP   Temp     95   18   94   147/70   98.6     62 YO female with history of osteoporosis slipped and fell off her outside deck landing on ground about 4 feet below. She was unable to get up, has pain in her left groin and is having a hard time talking with the heath aides because it hurts so bad, although their assessment is she didn't hurt anything else and isn't confused or otherwise injured. Leg described as foreshortened and rotated and she won't tolerate movement. Health aides think they need to get her out of there.","Question 20:     HR   RR   SpO2   BP   Temp     183   26   97   Not done   99.0     16-month-old ex full term male infant with no significant past medical history comes into CHAP clinic brought in by two new parents who report 2 hours of non-stop crying. They are worried as his cry seems different and he hasn't ever cried this much. No fever, illness or other problems noted. He had normal appetite for breast milk as usual earlier in the day and same number of wet diapers, although now he's crying incessantly he doesn't seem to be comforted by breastfeeding. Exam completed; not consolable but doesn't seem to have bulging fontanel, red ears, delayed cap refill, belly seems maybe distended to health aid and she's a little worried that it's tender on exam but hard to tell. No BMs while in the clinic but he won't eat either. He did vomit non-bilious emesis x 1, looked like curdled breast milk. You try Tylenol as a temporizing measure",Complete?
