# Table 4: Reporting Options

## OPTION 1: Keep Table 4 (Current Approach)

**Advantages:**
- Clear visual reference
- Easy to cite specific values
- Standard in some journals
- Comprehensive (shows all metrics)

**Keep as-is in report**

---

## OPTION 2: Report in Text Only (More Common in High-Impact Journals)

**Advantages:**
- Saves space
- More readable for general audience  
- Less intimidating
- Focus on interpretation over numbers

**Replace Table 4 with:**

> Variance component analysis revealed minimal between-physician heterogeneity (ICC = 1.1%, MOR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.00-2.26) compared to substantial between-vignette variation (ICC = 54.3%, MOR = 6.75, 95% CI: 3.29-26.74). The small physician MOR indicates that two randomly selected physicians would differ in their medevac propensity by an odds ratio of only 1.31, whereas two randomly selected vignettes would differ by an OR of 6.75—underscoring that clinical context dominates individual practitioner differences.

## MY RECOMMENDATION: **Keep Table 4**

**Why:** 
- Your comprehensive interpretation section (added after Table 4) makes excellent use of these values
- The MOR confidence intervals are important and deserve formal presentation
- Reviewers often want to see this explicitly
- You compare MORs to fixed effect ORs—having both in tables facilitates this

**But streamline it:**
- You could remove the ICC rows (report in text)
- Focus on MOR (the interpretable metric)
- Keep it short

## OPTION 3: Streamlined Table 4 (Best of Both)

| Component | Estimate | 95% CI |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Physician Variation** | | |
| Variance (log-odds) | 0.078 | — |
| MOR | 1.31 | 1.00 - 2.26 |
| ICC | 1.1% | — |
| | | |
| **Vignette Variation** | | |
| Variance (log-odds) | 4.006 | — |
| MOR | 6.75 | 3.29 - 26.74 |
| ICC | 54.3% | — |

**This version:**
- Shorter and cleaner
- Includes confidence intervals for MOR
- Keeps variance for completeness
- Easy to reference

## Current Report Status:

✅ Figure 3 (Utilization Rates) - REMOVED
✅ Figure 4 (Physician Caterpillar) - REMOVED  
✅ Figure 5 → Renamed to Figure 3 (Calibration Plot)
✅ Comprehensive MOR interpretation added after Table 4
✅ Table 4 currently kept with full details

**Your choice:** Keep Table 4 as-is, streamline it (Option 3), or remove it and report in text only.
